下面是他的自我介绍：

```
My name is Paul.
I've been an English teacher since 1988, and I've been teaching students online since 2003.
As an experienced teacher, I understand how students learn new information and skills and how they learn English.
What's the secret? There isn't a secret.
Learning English is really hard.
However, there are two things you must do:

Study hard and write!

write by hand

The secret to learning a new language lies in the skill of writing.
In the classes that I teach, I urge everyone to write as much as possible.
All of my students have notebooks, and they all write.
It's a simple method, but it works. You can do it, too!

My students are from all over the world:

Ethiopia, Mexico, Somalia, Vietnam, China, Cambodia, Central and South America, among others.

I originally built this website in 2003 for my students to use for free, but now 99% of the people who come here are from other states and other countries.
I'm still working on the website and adding to it daily.

Basically, I just wanted to create a free space on the internet that students think about going to when they're trying to figure out how to say something in English --beginners to advanced.

So don't expect too much at first from a free website.
You know, what they say--you get what you pay for.
